# Hands on Experience

## Testing Passive Videte Wheel

### New tire Material TPU

- Different floors work fine
- Ablation of TPU seems minimal
- Friction of the tire is sufficient
    * motor can't let the wheel slip
    * feels well connected
- Deformation of the tire is maybe to small
    * more deformation of the wheels surface could increase stability
    * print surface is too small

### Videte Wheel Concept

- Grab the wheel
    * Balances inside the wheel
    * Videte wheel is stable and reliable
- Small "stairs" work ok'ish
    * the passive videte wheel starts to oscillate for a short period
    * is able to regain stability
    * the motor / motor controller is not strong and fast enough for satisfactory tests
    * additionally there are wheel encoders missing
    ** they could enhance the balance control loop
    ** and would allow to stand on a slope
